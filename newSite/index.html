<p>For years, you’ve been torn between gaming in your living room and gaming at your desk.
     The living room has been the domain of consoles, big screens, and in-person multiplayer sessions,
      while your desk is the world of PC gaming, with high-end graphics and pinpoint peripheral precision.

    While it’s certainly been possible to plug a gaming PC into your TV and use a wireless mouse and keyboard to bring that experience into the living room, gaming this way has never been as good as at your desk, thanks to your TV simply not being a gaming monitor. Even the best TVs on the market can’t match the high refresh rates and extremely low response times of competent gaming monitors.
    
    HP’s Omen X Emperium 65 changes that. The first of Nvidia’s Big Format Gaming Displays (BFGD) to hit the market, the $4,999.99 Omen X is a 65-inch, 4K HDR screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and support for Nvidia’s G-Sync technology. It has a response time that’s much closer to a dedicated gaming monitor than a typical TV, and it is meant to be used just like you’d use a gaming monitor: plugged into a high-end gaming PC.
    
    Of course, since it is a giant screen, it can also behave as a TV, and it has an Nvidia Shield Android TV built into it as well. It also comes with a soundbar that puts out a surprising amount of volume and runs laps around the speakers that are built into most big-screen TVs.
    
    But, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Omen X 65 is far from perfect, and it requires more than a few compromises to bring PC gaming to your living room.</p>
